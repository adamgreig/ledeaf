# LEDEAF

A modular LED light inspired by [@GeekMomProjects]' project. Compared to the
original, this version:

* is drawn from scratch in KiCad
* uses the attaching bolts for electrical contact, instead of spring contacts
* only requires the front acrylic sheet
* all LEDs on each panel are driven by the same input data

The project is designed for SMT assembly by JLCPCB. Currently untested.
